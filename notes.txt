Steps to Work with JDBC and MySQL
1. Install Driver Class
The driver class is provided by the database software vendor.
For MySQL, the driver class is:
com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
2. Establish a Connection Between Java and Database
Use the DriverManager.getConnection() method to establish a connection.
The method requires three parameters:
Database URL (e.g., jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database)
Username (e.g., root)
Password (e.g., your database password)
Example:



Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database", "username", "password");
3. Working with SQL Queries
Query Types:
executeUpdate(): Used for non-select queries like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or CREATE TABLE.
executeQuery(): Used for SELECT queries to retrieve data from the database.
execute(): Used for general-purpose query execution when you're unsure of the type (not commonly used).
4. Create Objects for Database Operations
Connection Object:

Establish a connection with the database.
java
Copy
Edit
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
Statement Object:

Used to execute SQL queries.
java
Copy
Edit
Statement st = con.createStatement();
5. Execute SQL Queries
Execute an Update Query (e.g., create a table):
java
Copy
Edit
st.executeUpdate(sql_query);
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
String sql_query = "CREATE TABLE example_table (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100), age INT)";
st.executeUpdate(sql_query);
6. Close the Connection
Always close the Statement and Connection objects after use:
java
Copy
Edit
st.close();
con.close();
